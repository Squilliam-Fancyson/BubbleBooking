#Bubble Booking Scheduling System

*When rooms need booking, only one solution floats to the top.*

A room scheduling system designed by the Squilliam Fancyson team of the Fall 2016 semester of Software Modeling & Design at Auburn University.

Runs on the [Flask] web microframework. Built off of the [Flask-Foundation] project.

## Contributing

### Source Code
This project's source code is designed to be compatible with Python 3.3 and above, so any code developed for it must be tagged with a `#!usr/bin/env python3` shebang at the top to designate this. Attempts could theoretically be made to make code compatible with Python 2.7, but that feature is a stretch goal that (at this point) is unattainable.

Make sure you're gamiliar with git version control. We are using a style that incorporaes a standard development cycle into its branching, so pay close attention to how you merge and branch your code. Please use feature branches off of `dev` for anything you want to work on independently.
